# Kleff Code of Conduct

> Build. Host. Scale. Your Way — together.

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in the Kleff ecosystem a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing respect for people’s time and attention (do your homework before asking)

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment, bullying, or discrimination of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, including unsolicited sexual attention
- Publishing others’ private information (doxxing) without explicit permission
- Repeated disruptive behavior after being asked to stop

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all Kleff spaces, including GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, community channels, and private communication when it directly involves Kleff work or representation.

## Reporting

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, report it to the maintainers at [kleffioapp@gmail.com](mailto:kleffioapp@gmail.com).  
Include as much detail as possible (links, screenshots, timestamps). Reports are handled confidentially to the extent permitted.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards. They may take any action deemed appropriate, including editing or removing comments, closing issues/PRs, or banning contributors temporarily or permanently.

### Enforcement Guidelines

   *Consequence:* A private, written warning with clarity around expected behavior.

2. **Warning**  
   *Community Impact:* A single incident or series of actions that violate standards.  
   *Consequence:* A warning with consequences for continued behavior; may include temporary restrictions.

3. **Temporary Ban**  
   *Community Impact:* Serious or persistent violations.  
   *Consequence:* Temporary removal from community spaces and/or contribution activity.

4. **Permanent Ban**
