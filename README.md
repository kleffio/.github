# Kleff Organization Repository

Welcome to the **Kleff `.github` repository** —  
the central home for our community policies, guidelines, and organization-wide documentation.

> *Build. Host. Scale. Your Way.*

## 📘 Purpose

This repository defines how the Kleff community operates and collaborates across all projects within the organization.

It contains shared documentation such as:

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|

| [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) | Our community standards for respectful and inclusive behavior. |
| [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) | Responsible disclosure and vulnerability reporting policy. |

## 🧭 How These Files Work

GitHub automatically recognizes certain files inside `.github` to apply them across all repositories in the organization:

- **Community Health Files** — Code of Conduct, Contributing, and Security apply globally.  
- **Profile Readme** — The `profile/README.md` is displayed publicly on the organization’s main page.  
- **Workflow Templates** *(future use)* — You can later add reusable GitHub Actions or Issue Templates here for all Kleff repos.
