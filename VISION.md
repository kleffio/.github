# Kleff Vision

> “Build. Host. Scale. Your Way.”

Kleff is building the **next generation of self-hosted infrastructure** —  
a fully modular system that empowers developers to host **web and game servers**  
with the same level of control and polish as modern cloud platforms.

---

## 🌍 Our Mission

To make **hosting simple, scalable, and open-source**,  
bridging the gap between DIY self-hosting and enterprise-grade PaaS systems.

We believe in:
- **Transparency** — every piece of infrastructure should be understandable.
- **Modularity** — each component (auth, API, container, metrics) stands alone but integrates seamlessly.
- **Community** — open-source innovation drives our evolution.

## 🧱 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Open Architecture** | Every part of Kleff can be extended, replaced, or customized. |
| **Developer Empowerment** | Local-first, self-hosted deployments with full API access. |
| **Observability** | Real-time metrics through Prometheus & Grafana integrations. |
| **Scalability** | Built for distributed nodes and microservice scaling. |
| **Security First** | Strong authentication, sandboxed containers, and isolation layers. |
