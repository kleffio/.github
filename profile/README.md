## 🧠 What is Kleff?

**Kleff** is an open-source hosting platform designed to make **server deployment simple, powerful, and developer-friendly**.  
Inspired by Pterodactyl and Vercel, Kleff provides a **modular API-driven ecosystem** for hosting both **web** and **game servers** — built entirely around clean architecture and modern DevOps principles.

Whether you’re running a Minecraft server, deploying a full-stack web app, or managing CI/CD pipelines, Kleff gives you full control over your infrastructure — locally or in the cloud.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Kleff is composed of microservices that work together seamlessly:

| Service | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Auth Service** | Handles authentication, JWT sessions, and secure token management. |
| **Container Service** | Manages lifecycle of Docker containers (create, start, stop, restart, delete). |
| **API Gateway** | Entry point for all client and SDK interactions. |
| **Frontend Dashboard** | Modern UI for developers to deploy and monitor servers. |
| **Metrics & Monitoring** | Integration with Prometheus and Grafana for live server stats. |

Each service is containerized and built for horizontal scalability — perfect for distributed hosting setups.
